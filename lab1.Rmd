```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(rio)
library(here)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

```


```{r load data}

data <- import("~/Desktop/lab1/data/rstats_tweets.rds")

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
